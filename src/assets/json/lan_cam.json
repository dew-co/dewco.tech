      "LAN-Cam is a LAN-only camera and screen streaming tool that broadcasts to multiple devices on the same Wi-Fi with low latency and zero internet dependency. By keeping traffic local, it avoids cloud lag, bandwidth bills, and privacy concerns.",
      "It is built for classrooms, small offices, and at-home setups that need quick sharing without cloud complexity—simple discovery, QR/PIN joins, and a frictionless viewer keep the focus on the content. Broadcasters can switch between screen or webcam modes in seconds.",
      "Admins get predictable performance because the signalling layer is lightweight and can run entirely on-prem. Diagnostics, quality presets, and optional PIN/locks make it practical for teachers, trainers, and demo rooms that need a reliable local broadcast."
