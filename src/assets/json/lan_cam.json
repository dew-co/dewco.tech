  "about": {
    "short": "LAN-Cam is a LAN-only camera and screen streaming tool that broadcasts to multiple devices on the same Wi-Fi with low latency and zero internet dependency.",
    "long": "LAN-Cam makes it simple to broadcast a screen or camera feed to nearby devices without cloud services or cables. Any laptop or phone can be a broadcaster; viewers join via discovery or a LAN URL/QR code, and everything stays inside your network for speed and privacy.\n\nIt works for classrooms, training rooms, quick demos, or home viewing. The focus is on low-latency streaming, straightforward discovery, and a frictionless UX for non-technical users."
