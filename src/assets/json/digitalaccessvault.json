      "DigitalAccessVault is an in-house SaaS product from DewCo, built by Gloventis Solutions, to solve a simple but critical problem: managing passwords, identities, and secrets in a way that is secure, independent, and fully brand-owned. Instead of relying purely on third-party password managers, DigitalAccessVault offers a secure vault that DewCo can control, evolve, and offer as a service to users and organizations.",
      "The platform is a browser-based digital vault where users can store logins, credit cards, identities, secure notes, and SSH keys in one place. It is designed with a zero-knowledge style mindset: sensitive data is handled so that only the user can access their decrypted information, while the backend focuses on safe storage, access control, and telemetry.",
      "Built with React 19 and TypeScript on top of Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting, Analytics), DigitalAccessVault is structured as a SaaS product from day one. It supports personal vaults as well as future organization workspaces, where teams can share selected secrets securely while keeping everything auditable and organized under folders and categories.",
      "This product also acts as a live demonstration of the DewCo philosophy: taking everyday friction (password chaos, scattered secrets, dependence on external tools) and turning it into a branded, technically solid SaaS offering. DigitalAccessVault is both a tool for real users and a portfolio piece that showcases Gloventis’ ability to design, architect, and ship secure web applications."
