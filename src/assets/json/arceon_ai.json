The platform ingests files, converts them into structured data, applies policy checks, flags anomalies, and hands reviewers a guided queue for anything that needs human judgment.\n\nIt blends AI extraction with a Django/DRF backend, role-based access, and audit logs so enterprises get faster decisions without losing control or traceability."
