    "short": "Quant-Grade is an internal trading engine that runs multi-timeframe analysis on Indian equities and crypto, producing rule-based signals, risk levels, and optional automation hooks.",
    "long": "Quant-Grade brings structure to discretionary trading by treating every instrument through the same rule-based pipeline. The engine ingests market data, runs quant and technical models across multiple timeframes, and outputs directional bias with suggested levels.\n\nSignals surface in a web dashboard and can be piped to alerts or broker adapters for paper or live trading. The engine is modular, making it easy to test strategies, add AI-driven regime checks, and move toward a SaaS or white-label offer."
