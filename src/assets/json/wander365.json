    "short": "Wander365 is a full-stack travel experience platform that helps Indian travelers discover, customize, and book curated trips, while giving the travel team a powerful yet simple CRM to manage leads, packages, and itineraries. The brand is planned to evolve into ‘WanderRest’ as the product matures.",
    "long": "Wander365 started as a passion project to simplify how Indian travelers discover and book curated trips, weekend getaways, treks, and experiences. The goal is to make trip planning feel less like a chore and more like a conversation with a trusted travel partner.\n\nUnder Dew & Company (DewCo), Wander365 is being built as a modern travel brand that combines clean design, smart automation, and human-curated itineraries. In the future, the brand identity and positioning are planned to evolve into **WanderRest**, while the underlying product and platform continue to expand.\n\nThe public website helps users explore destinations, view detailed packages, and submit enquiries. On the backend, an internal admin CRM + CMS lets the team manage packages, itineraries, leads, and follow-ups in one place. The platform is designed as a travel OS that can later be extended into a white-label, multi-tenant solution for other travel agencies."
