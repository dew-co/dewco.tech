  "about": {
    "short": "TRAC App tracks remote devices in real time and lets admins trigger safe actions like lock, restart, or scripted commands from a single dashboard.",
    "long": "TRAC App tackles the visibility gap that appears once machines leave the office or classroom. A lightweight agent sends heartbeat, status, and optional activity hints, while the dashboard shows which devices are online, who is using them, and what actions are available.\n\nAdmins can drill into a machine, run safe remote actions, and review recent events without heavy enterprise tooling. The system stays modular so privacy-sensitive deployments can enable only the data and controls they need."
