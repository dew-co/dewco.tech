        "date": "2024-02-01",
        "context": "With the core architecture in place, February 2024 marked the shift from internal development to making Wander365 publicly accessible as a real product.",
        "problem": "Launching too early risks instability, while launching too late delays real user feedback. I needed a balanced production launch that was stable enough yet open to change.",
        "approach": "I adopted a soft-launch mindset—release a functional, usable product and observe real behavior instead of waiting for perfection.",
        "execution": "I deployed Wander365 to production with essential features only: destination discovery, basic navigation, and a clean UI. Monitoring, quick fixes, and iterative improvements were prioritized over feature expansion.",
        "challenges": "Ensuring reliability with limited testing resources and handling edge cases after launch required constant attention and rapid fixes.",
        "outcome": "Wander365 became a live, functioning travel platform, validating that the product could exist beyond an idea and be used by real users.",
        "learnings": "A real launch teaches more in one week than months of isolated development.",

        "title": "Core architecture decisions for Wander365",
        "date": "2024-01-01",
        "context": "At the start of 2024, I was transitioning from experimentation to building a real, scalable travel-tech product under my own vision. Wander365 needed to be fast, affordable to run, and flexible enough to evolve without a large team.",
        "problem": "Most early travel platforms fail because they over-engineer too early, incur high infrastructure costs, or depend on heavy backend systems before validating user behavior.",
        "approach": "I focused on a lean, frontend-first architecture with minimal backend dependency, prioritizing speed of development, low cost, and ease of iteration over premature complexity.",
        "execution": "I chose a modern frontend framework, cloud hosting, and a lightweight data layer that allowed rapid deployment. The architecture was designed to support incremental features like maps, destination data, and admin-driven content without rewriting the core system.",
        "challenges": "Balancing scalability with simplicity was the biggest challenge. I had to consciously avoid adding features or services that were not immediately necessary but tempting from an engineering perspective.",
        "outcome": "The decisions taken at this stage allowed Wander365 to move quickly from concept to a working product and later absorb new features without architectural rework.",
        "learnings": "Good architecture is not about adding more—it’s about choosing what to leave out until the product truly needs it.",
